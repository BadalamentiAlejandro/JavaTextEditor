"Text Editor" Java app with Swing

In this project I created a Text Editor using Java language and Swing library.

The code is modularized bearing in mind the different components that make the whole of the app. There is a Main Class where the JFrame is developed and subsecuent classes for the JPanel, JCompboBoxes, JTextPane and JScrollPane, JToolBar and JButtons.

There are comments in every class for the sake of guidance.

Hope you enjoy reading the project as much as I enjoyed writing it.
